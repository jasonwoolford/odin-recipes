The Odin Project's "Recipes" project step

In this project, the aim is to utilize the knowledge gained in the HTML section of The Odin Project.

Specifically, I aim to utilize boilerplate code typed by my own hand to reinforce my current familiarity with HTML, as well as give structure to this recipes page.  In addition to this boilerplate code, I will include proper titles, headings, text formatting, and anchor links to different recipes around the web that I am supplied with by The Odin Project.

Once this step is complete and my HTML is created, I will push this HTML into my GitHub repository (with a helpful commit message) for use later when I will have to revisit it for the CSS section.
