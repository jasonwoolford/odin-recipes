# odin-recipes
Personal repo for the "Odin Recipes" project from The Odin Project.

The aim is to reinforce my current familiarity of HTML and CSS to make a visually appealing site for the project, and to keep the scope of the page limited to what is asked so that I don't work on this thing too long needlessly.  I have so much more of the cirriculum to go through!
